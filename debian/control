Description: Mount arbitrary files via FUSE as a tree of chunk files.
 ChunkFS allows you to mount an arbitrary file or block device as a directory
 tree of read-only files that each represent a chunk of user-specified size
 of the mounted file.
 .
 A possible use for this is space-efficient incremental backups of
 encrypted filesystem images using rsync's --link-dest option.
 .
 The package also contains UnChunkFs, which allows you to mount a
 ChunkFS tree as an image file that mirrors the contents of whatever
 file or device the ChunkFS tree was created from.
