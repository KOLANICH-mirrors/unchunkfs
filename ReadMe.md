Florian Zumbiehl <florz@florz.de>, [PGP key BD1645ECDE3A9B483C7AADC09FE68022AF260AB1](https://chunkfs.florz.de/pgp_key_florz.asc) has created this tool. He can be found as `florz` on IRCNet, Freenode, and OFTC. His website is http://chunkfs.florz.de/. All the questions about the tool address to him.

I have only
* created a git repo for the tool because it is distributed in a form of archives with sources, no VCS access is available, it is a bit inconvenient
* applied some patches by @Aikhjarto to fix the build
* translated Makefile into a file for [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)

See https://chunkfs.florz.de/ for more information and new versions.
